<h1>SoothSayerAPI</h1>

This is the API backend to <a href="https://github.com/JustinLawrenceMS/SoothSayer">SoothSayer</a>

Install it as you would a Laravel app, but note the SQL dump for your convenience.

Also note the console command at ```php artisan sooths:index``` that you may have to
run when you make changes to the sooths table.

See it in action at <a href="https://soothsayer-api.com">soothsayer-api.com</a>
